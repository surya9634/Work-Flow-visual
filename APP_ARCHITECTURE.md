- Powers Leo AI (mini version)

**What Global AI Knows**:
```javascript
{
  // From Onboarding
  businessInfo: {
    name: "Tech Solutions",
    industry: "Software",
    description: "We sell CRM...",
    goals: "Increase sales",
    targetAudience: "Small businesses"

}
```

**How Global AI Works**:

   // Adds product to knowledge base
   // AI now knows about this product

   // Context includes:
   // - Business info
   // - All campaigns/products

Based on your data, this could increase conversions by 8%."

     Which fits your needs?"
