**Before**:
```
AI: "Our product has great features like X, Y, Z. 
Would you like to know more?"
```

**After**:
```
AI: *searches web for iPhone specs and reviews*
"Great question! Based on current market data, here's how 
we compare:

iPhone 15 Pro: $999, A17 chip, 48MP camera
Our Product: $799, Similar performance, 50MP camera

Reviews show our product has:
- 20% better battery life

### **Example 2: Pricing Calculation**

**Customer**: "What's the cost for 100 units with bulk discount?"

**Before**:
```
AI: "We offer bulk discounts! Let me check with the team."
```

**After**:
```
AI: *uses code interpreter to calculate*
"Excellent question! Here's your bulk pricing:

100 units × $99.99 = $9,999
Bulk discount (15%): -$1,500
Shipping (free over $5k): $0
---
