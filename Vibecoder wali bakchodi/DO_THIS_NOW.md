## 📝 Step 1: Add MongoDB Connection (2 minutes)

### Open this file:
```
backend/.env
```

### Find this line:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sales-automation
```

### Replace with your MongoDB Atlas connection string:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:yourpassword@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/sales-automation
```

### Where to get it:
1. Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Click **"Connect"** button on your cluster
3. Choose **"Connect your application"**
4. **Copy** the connection string
5. **Replace** `<password>` with your actual database password
6. **Paste** into `backend/.env`

**Example**:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://myuser:mypass123@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/sales-automation
```

## 💻 Step 2: Install Dependencies (3-5 minutes)

### Open Terminal 1:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Wait for it to complete** (you'll see packages being installed)

### Open Terminal 2:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Wait for it to complete**

## 🚀 Step 3: Start the Servers (30 seconds)

### In Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
npm run dev
```

**You should see**:
```
🚀 Server running on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Connected: cluster0.mongodb.net
📊 Environment: development
```

### In Terminal 2 (Frontend):
```bash
npm run dev
```

**You should see**:
```
VITE ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend Error: "MongoDB connection failed"
**Fix**: Check your connection string in `backend/.env`
- Make sure password is correct
- Make sure IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Try adding `0.0.0.0/0` to whitelist

### Frontend Error: "Cannot connect to server"
**Fix**: Make sure backend is running
- Check Terminal 1 shows "Server running on port 5000"
- Try: `http://localhost:5000/api/health` in browser
- Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`

### Port Already in Use
**Fix**: Change port in `backend/.env`
```env
PORT=5001
```
And in `frontend/.env`:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```
